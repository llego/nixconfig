## Current State

Headscale OIDC + Headplane deployed on VPS. All four hosts running. Crisuflix, laptop, VPS, and rpi5 Tailscale are now declarative with agenix Headscale preauth keys. Crisuflix registers as node `13` / `100.64.0.1` and advertises approved routes for `192.168.1.0/24` and `192.168.3.0/24`; laptop registers as node `14` / `100.64.0.3` and accepts routes; VPS registers as node `15` / `100.64.0.4` and accepts routes; rpi5 registers as node `16` / `100.64.0.5` and accepts routes. Headscale split DNS routes `llego.me.` to a VPS `dnsmasq` responder on `100.64.0.4`, which answers `*.llego.me` as crisuflix `100.64.0.1` for tailnet clients. Key services: OpenCloud 7.0.0 + Collabora (OIDC via Authelia), Homepage dashboard (NixOS service), restic backups (Hetzner), traefik-kop routing, Headscale OIDC via Authelia, Headplane Web UI. Traefik dashboard exposed at `https://traefik.cri.su` with Authelia protection.

DNS-01 ACME and DDNS fully migrated away from Cloudflare/EuroDNS to Hetzner across both traefik instances.

IoT network isolation completed: UniFi `192.168.3.0/24` moved to custom zone (CUSTOM1), avahi reflector enabled on crisuflix for cross-subnet mDNS. `192.168.1.103` alias removed from br0 — Shelly devices migrated to `192.168.3.103`.

README consolidated to remove duplicated architecture, dotfile, routing, and network guidance while preserving deployment commands and operational notes.
